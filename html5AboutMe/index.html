      <p>I'm MichaÅ‚, student on last year of bachelor degree - computer science
          in Akademia WSB. I started learning java in april 2022. I was 
          previously working as computers networks assembler and now as 
          networking engineer. Every day I'm learning somethink new about 
          Java or training what I was learned in this. After Java I would like 
          to start programming in Javascript. My interesting is traveling, 
          watching good serials as well as movie and reading about new 
          technology.</p>
